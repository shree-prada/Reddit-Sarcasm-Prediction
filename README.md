# Reddit Sarcasm Prediction

This project contains a machine learning model for predicting sarcasm in Reddit posts. The model uses a dataset of Reddit posts and corresponding sarcasm labels to identify sarcastic comments.

## Project Description
This project is a machine learning model for predicting sarcasm in Reddit posts. The dataset used for this project contains Reddit posts and corresponding sarcasm labels, which are used to train the model. The trained model can then be used to predict whether a new Reddit post is sarcastic or not.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook with the following:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Model training and evaluation
3. Model deployment
